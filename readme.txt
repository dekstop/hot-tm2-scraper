Scripts to extract information from the HOT tasking manager:
- a basic but polite scraper shell script
- Python parser scripts to extract misc information from the downloaded data

To look up the most recent project ID:
http://tasks.hotosm.org/?direction=desc&sort_by=created

The Python scripts have misc dependencies, most importantly GDAL to load and
process project boundary geometries.
